# Hues

Hues is a color picker for Mac OS X 10.10 and later, previously released by my now defunct company [Giant Comet](http://giantcomet.com/hues), now provided as free, open-source app.

## Alternatives

Hues is a simple app that provides some basic features on top of the built-in OS X color picker. If you're looking for something more full-featured, check out these great apps:

- [ColorSnapper](http://www.colorsnapper.com/)
