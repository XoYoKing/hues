# Hues

Hues is a color picker for Mac OS X 10.10 and later, previously released by my now defunct company [Giant Comet](http://giantcomet.com/hues), now provided as free, open-source app. It is built on top of the OS X color picker, and adds some extra features like automatically copying the color to the clipboard and seeing different color formats.

## Alternatives

Hues is a pretty simple app. If you're looking for something more full-featured, check out these great apps:

- [ColorSnapper](http://www.colorsnapper.com/)
- [Sip](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sip/id507257563?mt=12)
- [xScope](http://xscopeapp.com/)

## To Do

Hues hasn't been worked on since late 2011. Besides needing some updating and modernization (in progress), there's plenty other improvements to make:

### Features
- [ ] Rework color formatter and support more formats, including custom formats
- [ ] Add a menubar icon

### Distribution
- [ ] Sign with Developer ID
- [ ] Add Sparkle auto-updating

### Modernization/updating
- [x] Update to ARC (yes, it's that old)
